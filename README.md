# ax3s

This project visualizes the 3D motion of a particle based on continuous input data for position, velocity, and acceleration. The visualization can be done using Matplotlib and it can handle real-time updates.

## Features

- Real-time 3D plotting of particle trajectory
- Uses input data for velocity and acceleration to update particle position
- Handles window close events gracefully
- Supports both Matplotlib and Plotly for visualization

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
## Usage
- Instead of the random data stream for the velocities and accelerations, link up real data streams.
- Run the script : ```python plot.py```
- Change the plot update rate as required.
